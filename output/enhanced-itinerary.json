Its name, meaning “suspended in mid-air” in Swahili, captures the dreamlike magic of this extraordinary location. Just a short 10-minute drive from the Mara Triangle, the lodge sits on a 700-hectare private site with direct access to the reserve and unmatched exclusivity.\n\nEach tented suite is positioned along the escarpment’s edge, offering uninterrupted panoramas through floor-to-ceiling glass fronts. Inside, expect king beds, sleek wooden decks, and elegant interiors that blur the line between safari and luxury. A rim-flow pool, fitness room with valley views, a curated safari shop, and a hands-on photographic studio add thoughtful detail to the experience.\n\nSpend your days tracking the Big Five on game drives, soaring over the savannah in a hot-air balloon, walking along the escarpment, or exploring the Map Room for a deeper understanding of the region. \n\nInsider’s Tip: Visit the Photographic Studio during your stay, whether you're a seasoned photographer or a total beginner, you can book a private editing session or even print your own mini portfolio to take home.\n",

On a clear day you can even see Robben Island in the distance.\n\nThe popular hike is best tackled either first thing in the morning, or in the early evening. It takes approximately an hour to reach the summit (669m or 2,195 feet), but the hike can be broken up into sections to allow you to have time to stop and take in the changing views as you loop around the mountain. \n\nYou may choose to plan for a picnic once you reach the top, or if you find yourself in the Mother City during a full moon, join the local hikers at the summit for a spectacular moon rise. \n\nThe hike includes two sets of short ladders bolted to the rock face.",

Garden Lodge offers panoramic views and every suite offers complete privacy. Garden Lodge lies in an indigenous garden with stone walls and a warm African ambience.

Dedicated conservationists accompany guests daily on awe-inspiring excursions to explore the flora, fauna, bird and marine life of the area by foot, boat, horseback or in an open 4x4 vehicle. From June to December marvel at the Southern Right Whales that may be viewed from the rocky cliffs, pure white beaches, by boat or light airplane.\n\nINSIDER'S TIP: We are in the heart of the Cape Floral Kingdom - the smallest but richest of the six floral kingdoms – and at Grootbos 760 of the 9000 fynbos species found in the Cape grow here.",

            "description": "Wake up on the banks of the mighty Zambezi River at Matetsi Victoria Falls. Tucked away along 27 kilometres of private river frontage, Matetsi Victoria Falls blends contemporary African luxury with the raw beauty of its surroundings. The lodge’s vibrant interiors pay homage to Zimbabwe’s rich heritage, showcasing copper accents from the country’s mining history and bold blue hues inspired by the legendary river itself. Each of the river-facing suites offers a front-row seat to the outdoors, complete with a private plunge pool, a spacious veranda, and floor-to-ceiling windows that blur the line between indoors and out. Designed for comfort and style, the suites feature local materials, intricate carvings, and modern touches that create a warm, inviting atmosphere.\nMatetsi’s two intimate camps, with their own dining spaces, fire-lit lounges, and interactive kitchens, offer a personalised experience – whether you're enjoying a meal under the stars or relaxing by the fire bowl. For families or groups, the exclusive-use Matetsi River House offers a private villa with its own dedicated chef, butler and safari team, for an unparalleled experience.\n\nINSIDER’S TIP: Don’t miss a soak in the outdoor tub, where you can unwind while watching the mesmerising flow of the river. It’s the perfect way to end a day on safari.\n",

Dedicated conservationists accompany guests daily on awe-inspiring excursions to explore the flora, fauna, bird and marine life of the area by foot, boat, horseback or in an open 4x4 vehicle.
